Presumably this is due to the fact that shearing is amplifying the pressure anisotropy for some modes, and the mirror threshold is being reached before the wave are damped. Our goal was to study this effect in a localized 2D shearing simulation with an isolated ion acoustic mode and compare the results with analytic predictions.</p><p>skills: <mark>hybrid-PIC simulations</mark>, <mark>plasma theory</mark></p>"

Photons produced via the synchrotron radiation of the accelerated plasma particles, can interact with each other to produce fresh pair-plasma. This process self-balances towards an equilibrium which depends weakly on specific reconnection pulsar conditions. We developed the first-of-its-kind pair-production algorithm for PIC codes coupled to the synchrotron radiation of charged particles to demonstrate this self-balancing phenomenon in localized reconnection simulations.</p><p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10772'>arXiv:1809.10772</a></p><p>skills: <mark>PIC simulations</mark>, <mark>PIC code dev</mark></p>"
